##  Usage Disclaimer
Additional Notice on Generated Voices

This project provides a speech synthesis model for voice design, intended for academic research, educational purposes, and legitimate applications, such as personalized speech synthesis, assistive technologies, and linguistic research.

Please note:

Do not use this model for unauthorized voice cloning, impersonation, fraud, scams, deepfakes, or any illegal or malicious activities.

Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations when using this model and uphold ethical standards.

The developers assume no liability for any misuse of this model.

Important clarification regarding generated voices:

As a generative model, the voices produced by this system are synthetic outputs inferred by the model, not recordings of real human voices.

The generated voice characteristics do not represent or reproduce any specific real individual, and are not derived from or intended to imitate identifiable persons.

We advocate for the responsible development and use of AI and encourage the community to uphold safety and ethical principles in AI research and applications.
